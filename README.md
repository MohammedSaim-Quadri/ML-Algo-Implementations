## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the repository and start experimenting.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.8 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohammedSaim-Quadri/ML-Algo-Implementations.git
   cd ML-Algo-Implementations
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/MacOS
    venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Features
- Well-organized structure: Separate folders for different types of algorithms.
- Comprehensive examples: Includes Jupyter notebooks for each algorithm with clear explanations and code.
- Practical datasets: Demonstrations use real-world datasets to showcase the applicability of each algorithm.
- Educational content: Perfect for beginners and intermediate learners to build a solid foundation in machine learning.

## Usage
- Navigate to the folder of the desired algorithm (e.g., Classification/).
- Open the corresponding Jupyter notebook in your browser.
- Follow the explanations and execute the code cells to understand the algorithm.
- Modify the code or datasets to experiment further.
